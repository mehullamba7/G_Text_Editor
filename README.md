# About

Welcome to my custom text editor project! This text editor is written in C and packs a lot of functionality into just around 1000 lines of code. Designed with efficiency and usability in mind, this editor provides a robust set of features tailored for developers.

#### Key Features:

- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: 
  - **Ctrl+Q** to quit the editor.
  - **Ctrl+F** to find specific text within the file.
  - **Ctrl+S** to save the current file.

- **Syntax Highlighting**: 
  - Supports multiple programming languages including C, C++, Python, and more.
  - Highlights different keywords, comments, strings, and numbers for better code visibility and organization.

- **File Management**:
  - Create, open, edit, and save files with ease.
  - Provides a seamless experience for managing your code and text files.

This project is a testament to how efficient a text editor can be, even with a minimal codebase. Feel free to explore the code, contribute, and suggest improvements!
