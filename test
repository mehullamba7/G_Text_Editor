This is a test file , made and saved using the 'G' text editor.
This text editor can save, edit and make new files, it even has a 'find' option using 'Ctrl + F' and save using 'Ctrl + S' and easy quit using 'Ctrl + Q'
But it wont just quit your program if it has unsaved changes, you have to confirm it thrice if thats the case

This is fun, i can write codes in my own text editor
Lets save this now with the name of ? ... I guess test.txt
